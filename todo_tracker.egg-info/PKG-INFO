# Todo Tracker

A powerful CLI-based todo task tracker with versioning, attachments, and Kanban visualization.

## Features

*   **Task Management**: Create, update, and manage tasks with descriptions, deadlines, and statuses.
*   **Versioning**: Every change to a task is versioned. You can view the full history of a task and revert to previous states (conceptually).
*   **Attachments**: Attach files to tasks. Files are stored efficiently using content-addressable storage (deduplication).
*   **Aliases**: Tasks are assigned human-readable aliases (e.g., `Misty-Rat`) for easier reference than UUIDs.
*   **Kanban Board**: Visualize your tasks in a terminal-based Kanban board.
*   **Archiving**: Archive completed or stale tasks to keep your active list clean.
*   **JSON Dump**: Export your data to JSON for backup or analysis.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd todo-tracker
    ```

2.  Install the package:
    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

    Or for development (editable mode):
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

## Usage

The main command is `todo`.

### Basic Operations

*   **Add a task:**
    ```bash
    todo add "Buy groceries" --deadline 2023-12-31
    ```

*   **List tasks:**
    ```bash
    todo list
    todo list --all  # Include archived tasks
    ```

*   **Show task details:**
    ```bash
    todo show <task_id_or_alias>
    ```

*   **Update a task:**
    ```bash
    todo update <id> --status "in-progress" --desc "Buy organic groceries"
    ```

### Attachments

*   **Attach a file:**
    ```bash
    todo attach <id> ./path/to/file.txt
    ```

*   **Extract an attachment:**
    ```bash
    todo extract <id> file.txt --output ./downloaded_file.txt
    ```

### Organization & Visualization

*   **Kanban View:**
    ```bash
    todo kanban pending in-progress done
    ```

*   **Archive/Unarchive:**
    ```bash
    todo archive <id>
    todo unarchive <id>
    ```

*   **Delete:**
    ```bash
    todo delete <id>
    ```

### Advanced

*   **View History:**
    ```bash
    todo history <id>
    ```

*   **Duplicate Task:**
    ```bash
    todo duplicate <id>
    ```

*   **Dump Data:**
    ```bash
    todo dump --output backup.json
    todo dump --history --all --output full_backup.json
    ```

## Data Storage

Data is stored in a `.todo_store` directory in the current working directory. This directory contains:
*   `objects/`: Content-addressable storage for task versions and attachment blobs.
*   `refs/`: References to the current version of each task.
*   `orchestrator.lock`: Lock file to ensure data integrity during concurrent access.

## Development

To run tests:

```bash
pytest
```
